# Email Verification Debugging Guide

## Changes Made

I've added comprehensive logging to track the email verification flow:

### 1. Server-side Logging Added

**File: `/server/routes.ts` (lines 543-594)**
- Logs when verification endpoint is called
- Shows token being used
- Displays user found status
- Shows before/after emailVerified state
- Confirms database update success

**File: `/server/replitAuth.ts` (lines 217-224)**
- Logs every login attempt
- Shows user's emailVerified status at login time
- Confirms why login is allowed or denied

### 2. New Debug Script

**File: `/scripts/check-user-verification.ts`**
- Check any user's verification status
- View verification token if present
- Get direct verification link

## Testing Steps

### Step 1: Register a New User

1. Go to registration page
2. Fill in details (use a test email you control)
3. Click "Register"
4. **Check server console** - you should see:
   ```
   === EMAIL VERIFICATION (Development Mode) ===
   To: your-email@example.com
   Click the following link to verify your email:
   http://localhost:5000/verify-email?token=...
   ```

### Step 2: Verify Email

1. Copy the verification link from console
2. Paste in browser
3. **Check server console** - you should see:
   ```
   üìß Email verification attempt with token: abc123...
   ‚úÖ Found user: your-email@example.com emailVerified: false
   üîÑ Updating user verification status for: your-email@example.com
   ‚úÖ Verification update result: SUCCESS
   Updated user emailVerified: true
   ```

4. Browser should show success message with green styling
5. Click "Continue to Login" button

### Step 3: Login

1. Enter email and password
2. Click "Login"
3. **Check server console** - you should see:
   ```
   üîê Login attempt for user: your-email@example.com emailVerified: true
   ‚úÖ Email verified, allowing login for: your-email@example.com
   ```

4. Should successfully log in

## Troubleshooting

### Check User Status Manually

Run this command with your test email:

```bash
tsx scripts/check-user-verification.ts your-email@example.com
```

This will show:
- User ID
- Email verified status (true/false)
- Verification token (if present)
- Direct verification link (if token exists)

### Common Issues

#### Issue 1: "User not found with token"
**Cause:** Token doesn't match database
**Fix:**
1. Run check script to get current token
2. Use that exact token in verification URL

#### Issue 2: "Email already verified" but login fails
**Cause:** Database might not be updating or caching issue
**Fix:**
1. Run check script to confirm database state
2. If emailVerified is false, manually verify:
   ```bash
   # Direct database update
   psql $DATABASE_URL -c "UPDATE users SET email_verified = true WHERE email = 'your-email@example.com';"
   ```

#### Issue 3: Verification succeeds but login still fails
**Cause:** Browser might be caching old user state
**Fix:**
1. Clear browser cache/cookies
2. Try in incognito window
3. Check console logs to see actual database value

## What to Check

When you test, please share:

1. **Console output from registration** (the verification link)
2. **Console output from verification** (the üìß logs)
3. **Console output from login attempt** (the üîê logs)
4. **Output from check script**:
   ```bash
   tsx scripts/check-user-verification.ts your-test-email@example.com
   ```

This will help identify exactly where the flow is breaking!

## Expected Flow

```
Registration
    ‚Üì
    [emailVerified: false, token: abc123]
    ‚Üì
Email Sent (console log)
    ‚Üì
User Clicks Link
    ‚Üì
Verification API Called
    ‚Üì
    [emailVerified: true, token: null]
    ‚Üì
Success Page Shown
    ‚Üì
User Clicks "Continue to Login"
    ‚Üì
Login Form
    ‚Üì
Login Check (emailVerified === true)
    ‚Üì
‚úÖ Login Success
```

## Next Steps

Please run through the test flow and share the console logs. This will help me identify if:

1. ‚ùå Verification API is not being called
2. ‚ùå Database update is not executing
3. ‚ùå Login is reading stale data
4. ‚ùå Some other middleware is interfering

The logs will tell us exactly where the issue is!
