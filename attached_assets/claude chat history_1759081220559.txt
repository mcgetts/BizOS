> two items you need to work on - the verification process is still not working - I can click on the verification link and it takes me to a page 
like it is almost going back to the application but then goes blank.  when I manually go back to the sign in page it will not let me access the 
app as it says verification is not complete even though it has set up the team member in the system - so investigat ad fully fix.  The second item
 is that I still cannot manage team members in the Team page - CRUD functionality is not there or consistent across views and Admins and other 
roles with permissions but be able to fully manage members/users - you also need to fix the view/edit/delete functionaly on the action button and 
also add edit/delete buttons when viewing member details

● I need to investigate and fix both issues. Let me start by checking what's happening with the verification process and then address the team
  management CRUD functionality.

● First, let me check the server logs to see if there are any errors when accessing the verification page:

● BashOutput(Reading shell output)

● Let me start a fresh server instance and check the issue with the blank verification page:

● Bash(npm run dev:safe)
  ⎿  Running in the background (down arrow to manage)

● Let me wait for the server to start and then test the verification issue. First, let me check if there's a problem with the route matching. The
  issue might be that the verification page shows up briefly but then gets replaced by a blank page due to authentication checks:

● Read(client/src/App.tsx)
  ⎿  Read 20 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

● I see a potential issue! The verification route is only available when !isAuthenticated, but if the useAuth hook is loading or has
  authentication state that changes, it might cause the page to disappear. Let me check the useAuth hook and fix this by making the verification
  route always available:

● Update(client/src/App.tsx)
  ⎿  Updated client/src/App.tsx with 4 additions and 4 removals                    
       36    
       37      return (
       38        <Switch>
       39 +        {/* Email verification should always be accessible */}
       40 +        <Route path="/verify-email" component={EmailVerification} />
       41 +  
       42          {!isAuthenticated ? (
       43 -          <>
       44 -            <Route path="/" component={Landing} />
       45 -            <Route path="/verify-email" component={EmailVerification} />
       46 -          </>
       43 +          <Route path="/" component={Landing} />
       44          ) : (
       45            <>
       46              <Route path="/" component={Dashboard} />

● Now let me check the server status:

● I'll continue testing the email verification flow to ensure the blank page issue is completely resolved, then move on to fixing the team
  management CRUD functionality.

● Bash(curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/auth/verify-email -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"token": "verification-token-2025"}' -w

     }

● The verification token appears to be invalid. Let me create a fresh test user and immediately test the verification process:

● Bash(npm run tsx scripts/create-test-user.ts)
  ⎿  Error: npm error Missing script: "tsx"
     npm error
     npm error To see a list of scripts, run:
     npm error   npm run

  ⎿  👤 Creating test user for verification flow...
     ✅ Created test user successfully!

● Now let me test the verification API endpoint with the fresh token:

● Bash(curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/auth/verify-email -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"token": "verification-token-2025"}' -w

       "message": "Email verified successfully! You can now log in."
     }
     … +5 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

● Perfect! The API endpoint is working correctly. Now let me test the full browser flow to see if the blank page issue is resolved. Let me also
  check which server is actually running:

● Bash(netstat -tlnp | grep :5000)
  ⎿  bash: netstat: command not found

● Bash(ss -tlnp | grep :5000)
  ⎿  bash: ss: command not found

● Bash(lsof -i :5000)
  ⎿  Error: bash: lsof: command not found

● Let me test the frontend verification page directly to ensure it loads properly:
