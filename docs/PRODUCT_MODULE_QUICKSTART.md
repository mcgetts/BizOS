# Product Management Module - Quick Start

**TL;DR**: Add product management capabilities to BizOS for planning, backlog management, sprints, and releases.

---

## üéØ What Is This?

A complete **Product Management layer** that sits above your existing Projects/Tasks system:

```
TODAY (Project Execution Only):
Projects ‚Üí Tasks ‚Üí Time Tracking

TOMORROW (Strategy + Execution):
Products ‚Üí Epics ‚Üí Features ‚Üí User Stories ‚Üí Tasks ‚Üí Projects
              ‚Üì
         Sprints ‚Üí Releases ‚Üí Roadmap
```

---

## üí° Why Build It?

### The Problem
- ‚úÖ You have great **project execution** (tasks, Gantt, time tracking)
- ‚ùå Missing **product strategy** layer (epics, backlog, sprints)
- ‚ùå ROADMAP.md is manual markdown (no automation)
- ‚ùå No prioritization frameworks (RICE, MoSCoW)
- ‚ùå No sprint management or velocity tracking

### The Solution
Build an integrated Product Management module that:
1. **Automates ROADMAP.md** - Two-way sync with database
2. **Enables prioritization** - RICE scores, drag-drop backlog
3. **Tracks sprints** - Kanban board, burndown charts, velocity
4. **Plans releases** - Version management with auto-generated notes
5. **Links to existing system** - Features ‚Üí Stories ‚Üí Tasks

### The Value
- **Dogfooding**: Manage BizOS development with BizOS
- **Differentiation**: Few competitors have integrated product management
- **Revenue**: Premium feature for Professional/Enterprise tiers
- **Internal efficiency**: Save 4+ hours/week in planning

## üé® Key Features

### 1. ROADMAP.md Sync

**Automatic Import**:
```
ROADMAP.md Phase 11        ‚Üí Epic in database
ROADMAP.md Item (checkbox) ‚Üí Feature in database
[ ] unchecked             ‚Üí status: "backlog"
[x] checked               ‚Üí status: "completed"
7/15 (47%)                ‚Üí epic.progressPercentage = 47
```

**Automatic Export**:
When you complete a feature in the UI, ROADMAP.md automatically updates:
```markdown
Before: - [ ] **Command Palette** ... (0/15)
After:  - [x] **Command Palette** ... (1/15, 7%)
```

### 2. RICE Prioritization

**Formula**: `(Reach √ó Impact √ó Confidence) / Effort`

**Example**:
```
Command Palette:
- Reach: 1000 users/month
- Impact: 2 (high)
- Confidence: 80%
- Effort: 2 person-months
RICE Score = (1000 √ó 2 √ó 0.8) / 2 = 800 ‚úÖ High priority
```

### 3. Sprint Board

**Kanban Columns**:
```
To Do | In Progress | Review | Done
  ‚Üì         ‚Üì          ‚Üì       ‚Üì
[Story]  [Story]   [Story]  [Story]
[Story]  [Story]            [Story]
```

**Metrics**:
- Burndown chart (actual vs ideal)
- Velocity (story points per sprint)
- Sprint health (on track, at risk, late)

### 4. Release Planning

**Features**:
- Assign features to releases
- Auto-generate release notes from features
- Changelog generation
- Version timeline

  - 10 users = $70-200/month = $840-2,400/year saved
- **Better integration**: Perfect fit with existing system
- **Competitive advantage**: Unique feature for sales
- **Dogfooding**: We use what we sell

**ROI**: Positive in 2-3 months

## ü§î FAQ

**Q: Why not just use Jira/Linear/ProductBoard?**
A: Those are great tools, but:
- ‚ùå Monthly per-user fees ($7-20/user)
- ‚ùå Requires switching between tools
- ‚ùå Data silos (product data separate from project data)
- ‚úÖ Building it = perfect integration + no fees + competitive advantage

**Q: Can we start with MVP and expand later?**
A: Absolutely! Recommended approach:
- Week 1-3: MVP (products, epics, features, ROADMAP sync)
- Get feedback, iterate
- Then add sprints, backlog, releases incrementally

**Q: Will this replace our existing Projects/Tasks?**
A: No, it **complements** them:
- Products/Epics/Features = **What to build** (strategy)
- Projects/Tasks = **How to build it** (execution)
- User Stories link the two layers

**Q: How does it work with client projects?**
A: Two ways:
1. **Internal products** (BizOS): No project linkage needed
2. **Client products**: Feature ‚Üí Project ‚Üí Tasks

**Q: What if we already use another tool?**
A: Phase 15 roadmap includes integrations:
- Jira import/export
- Linear sync
- We can build adapters

**Q: Is this overkill for small teams?**
A: MVP is lightweight:
- Just products + epics + features
- Adds structure without overhead
- Can skip sprints if not doing agile

- ‚úÖ Low risk (MVP is small scope)
- ‚úÖ Can expand incrementally

Start with:
1. Basic product/epic/feature management
2. ROADMAP.md sync
3. Simple roadmap visualization

Then add:
4. Backlog prioritization (Week 3)
5. Sprints (Week 4-5)
6. Releases (Week 6)

**Let's build it!** üöÄ
