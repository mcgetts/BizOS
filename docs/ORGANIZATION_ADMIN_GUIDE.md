## Understanding Organizations

### What is an Organization?
An organization represents a complete tenant workspace with:
- **Isolated data**: Each org has its own projects, tasks, clients, etc.
- **Separate users**: Users must be members of an org to access its data
- **Custom subdomain**: Each org is accessed via `{subdomain}.yourdomain.com`
- **Plan-based limits**: Different plans allow different numbers of users
- **Independent settings**: Branding, features, and notifications per org

### Organization Properties

| Property | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| **Name** | Display name of the organization | "Acme Corporation" |
| **Subdomain** | Unique identifier for URL routing | "acme" ‚Üí acme.yourdomain.com |
| **Slug** | URL-safe identifier (usually same as subdomain) | "acme" |
| **Plan Tier** | Subscription level (free, starter, professional, enterprise) | "professional" |
| **Status** | Current state of organization | "active", "trial", "suspended", "cancelled" |
| **User Limit** | Maximum number of members allowed | 50 |
| **Billing Email** | Contact for billing notifications | billing@acme.com |

---

## Best Practices

### Naming Conventions

**Subdomains**:
- Use company/client name: `acme`, `techcorp`
- Keep it short: 3-15 characters
- Avoid numbers unless meaningful: `client123` ‚ùå `acmecorp` ‚úì
- Use hyphens for multi-word: `big-company` ‚úì

**Organization Names**:
- Use proper business name: "Acme Corporation"
- Include entity type if needed: "Tech Startup LLC"
- Be consistent with branding

### Security

1. **Limit Owners**: Each org should have 1-2 owners maximum
2. **Regular Audits**: Review member lists quarterly
3. **Remove Inactive Users**: Free up seats, improve security
4. **Trial Management**: Set clear expiration policies

### Data Management

1. **Backups**: Ensure organizations are included in backup strategy
2. **Before Deletion**: Export critical data first
3. **Subdomain Changes**: Avoid if possible; communicate widely if necessary

### Billing

1. **Separate Billing Emails**: Use `billing@` addresses
2. **Plan Reviews**: Audit plans quarterly to optimize costs
3. **Trial Extensions**: Handle manually or via status changes

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "Subdomain already exists"
**Problem**: Trying to create org with duplicate subdomain
**Solution**: Choose a different subdomain, check existing orgs

#### "Organization has reached maximum user limit"
**Problem**: Trying to add member when at capacity
**Solutions**:
1. Upgrade the plan tier
2. Remove inactive members
3. Wait for members to leave

#### "Cannot delete default organization"
**Problem**: System prevents deletion of "default" org
**Solution**: This is intentional - default org is required for system operation

#### "Cannot remove the last owner"
**Problem**: Trying to remove the only owner
**Solution**:
1. Promote another member to owner first
2. Then remove the original owner

#### User Can't Access Organization
**Possible Causes**:
1. User not a member of the organization
2. Organization is suspended/cancelled
3. User accessing wrong subdomain
4. User account is inactive

**Solutions**:
1. Add user to organization members
2. Change org status to "active"
3. Verify correct subdomain URL
4. Check user account status

### Getting Help

If you encounter issues:
1. Check system logs for error details
2. Verify user permissions and roles
3. Test with a trial organization first
4. Review recent changes to organization settings
