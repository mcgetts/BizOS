- **Authentication**: Multi-method (Local + OAuth)
- **Key Features**: Real-time WebSocket, AI analytics, mobile-first design
- **Integrations**: Slack, Teams, GitHub with workflow automation
- **Performance Targets**: <2s page load, <500ms API response

### `business-domains.yaml`
**Domain-Driven Design Implementation** - Business capability organization
- **5 Core Domains**: Project Management, CRM, Financial, Team Resource, Analytics
- **Domain Boundaries**: Clear separation with defined integration points
- **Business Rules**: Domain-specific constraints and invariants
- **Service Architecture**: Domain services and application services
- **Integration Patterns**: Cross-domain communication strategies

## 🎯 Usage Guidelines

### For Architects and Lead Developers
- **System Overview**: Start with `system-architecture.yaml` for complete system understanding
- **Domain Design**: Use `business-domains.yaml` for understanding business capabilities
- **Technology Decisions**: Reference technology stack and architectural patterns
- **Scaling Strategy**: Review modular monolith approach and future microservices options

### For New Team Members
1. **Read `system-architecture.yaml`** first for complete system context
2. **Study `business-domains.yaml`** to understand business functionality
3. **Cross-reference with technical specs** in `/technical/` directory
4. **Review integration capabilities** for workflow automation understanding

### For Business Stakeholders
