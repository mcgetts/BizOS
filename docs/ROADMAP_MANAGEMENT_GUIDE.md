```

#### 2. Review Priorities

**Questions to ask:**
```markdown
1. Are we working on the highest-value items?
2. Have priorities changed based on user feedback?
3. Are there new urgent needs?
4. Should we re-order phases?
```

**Adjust if needed:**
```markdown
# In ROADMAP.md, change priority stars:
Before: Phase 15: Enterprise    ⭐⭐⭐
After:  Phase 15: Enterprise    ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐  (if enterprise deals are closing)
```

Quarter 4: Phase 16
```

**Adjust based on:**
- Actual completion velocity
- Business priorities

---

## ✅ Best Practices

### 1. Keep It Updated

**Minimum Update Frequency:**
- Daily: Task progress notes
- Weekly: Status changes, progress percentages
- Monthly: Metrics, priorities

**Why it matters:**
- ✅ Single source of truth
- ✅ Visibility for stakeholders
- ✅ Historical record of decisions

### 2. Use Clear Status Indicators

**Always use emojis:**
```markdown
✅ DO:   - Status: 🟡 In Progress
❌ DON'T: - Status: In Progress
```

**Why:**
- Visual scanning is faster
- Consistent with dashboard
- Easy to search with grep

### 3. Document Decisions

**When changing priorities:**
```markdown
- [ ] **Global Search**
  - Status: 🔵 Planned → ⏸️ On Hold
  - Reason: Deprioritized for Performance work
  - Decision Date: 2025-10-15
  - Will resume: Q2 2026
```

### 4. Celebrate Wins

**When completing items:**
```markdown
✅ Command Palette - Completed!
   - 45 keyboard shortcuts
   - 34% user adoption in first week
   - 12% faster task creation
   - User quote: "This is a game changer!" - @user123
```

### 5. Track Blockers Proactively

**Don't wait until standup:**
```markdown
- [ ] **Email Integration**
  - Status: 🔴 Blocked
  - Blocker: Waiting for OAuth approval from Gmail
  - Owner: Mike Johnson
  - Escalated to: Product Manager
  - Alternative: Start with IMAP/SMTP instead
  - Decision deadline: 2025-10-20
```

### 6. Estimate Realistically

**Use historical data:**
```markdown
# After completing a few items, you'll see patterns:
- Small (1-2 days): Avg actual = 1.8 days
- Medium (3-4 days): Avg actual = 4.2 days
- Large (5-7 days): Avg actual = 7.5 days

# Adjust future estimates accordingly
```

### 7. Balance Quick Wins and Strategic Work

**Good sprint mix:**
```markdown
Sprint Items (2 weeks):
- 2 Quick Wins (boost morale, show progress)
- 1 Medium complexity item (steady progress)
- 1 Large strategic item (long-term value)
```

---

## 🔧 Advanced Workflows

### Using GitHub Issues for Tracking

**Create issue template:**
```markdown
Title: [Phase XX] Feature Name

**Roadmap Reference**: ROADMAP.md Line XXX
**Phase**: 11
**Priority**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Effort**: Medium (3-4 days)
**Owner**: @username

**Description**:
[Copy from roadmap]

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Criteria 1
- [ ] Criteria 2
- [ ] Tests written
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Roadmap updated

**Dependencies**:
- None

**Links**:
- Roadmap: [ROADMAP.md](../ROADMAP.md)
- Dashboard: [ROADMAP_DASHBOARD.md](../docs/ROADMAP_DASHBOARD.md)
```

**Label Strategy:**
```markdown
Labels:
- phase-11, phase-12, etc.
- priority-high, priority-medium, priority-low
- quick-win
- status-planning, status-in-progress, status-blocked
- area-frontend, area-backend, area-fullstack
```

### Automation Scripts

**Auto-update progress from git commits:**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# scripts/update-roadmap-progress.sh

# Count completed items from commit messages
completed=$(git log --all --grep="Complete:" --since="1 month ago" --oneline | wc -l)

echo "Completed last 30 days: $completed items"

# You can extend this to auto-update ROADMAP.md
```

**Generate weekly report:**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# scripts/weekly-report.sh

echo "=== Weekly Roadmap Report ==="
echo ""
echo "In Progress:"
grep "🟡 In Progress" ROADMAP.md | grep -o "\*\*.*\*\*" | sed 's/\*\*//g'
echo ""
echo "Completed This Week:"
git log --all --grep="Complete:" --since="1 week ago" --pretty=format:"- %s"
echo ""
echo "Blocked:"
grep "🔴 Blocked" ROADMAP.md | grep -o "\*\*.*\*\*" | sed 's/\*\*//g'
```

### Metrics Tracking Spreadsheet

**Create Google Sheet with columns:**
```
Week | Items Completed | Total Progress | Load Time | Bundle Size | User Satisfaction
W1   | 2              | 2/108 (2%)     | 4.2s      | 2.1MB       | Baseline
W2   | 3              | 5/108 (5%)     | 3.8s      | 1.9MB       | +5%
W3   | 2              | 7/108 (6%)     | 3.5s      | 1.7MB       | +8%
```

**Benefits:**
- Charts and graphs
- Trend analysis
- Stakeholder sharing

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Problem: Too many items in progress

**Symptom:**
```markdown
### In Progress (12)
🟡 Item 1
🟡 Item 2
... (10 more)
```

**Solution:**
```markdown
1. Limit Work In Progress (WIP)
   - Max 1-2 items per developer
   - Max 5-6 items total for team

2. Focus on completion over starting
   - Finish before starting new items
   - "Stop starting, start finishing"
```

### Problem: Items taking longer than estimated

**Symptom:**
```markdown
- Estimated: 2-3 days
- Actual: Day 7, still in progress
```

**Solution:**
```markdown
1. Break down into smaller tasks
   - Large → Multiple Medium items

2. Identify what was missed
   - Unexpected complexity?
   - Scope creep?
   - Interruptions?

3. Update estimate for future
   - Document learnings
   - Adjust similar estimates
```

### Problem: Losing motivation, no visible progress

**Symptom:**
```markdown
Overall Progress: 3/108 (3%) after 4 weeks
```

**Solution:**
```markdown
1. Focus on percentage per phase, not total
   Phase 11: 5/15 (33%) ← This looks better!

2. Track leading indicators
   - Code commits per week
   - Features shipped (even small ones)
   - User feedback received

3. Celebrate small wins
   - Share each completion with team
   - Demo to users
   - Track impact metrics
```

### Problem: Priorities keep changing

**Symptom:**
```markdown
Week 1: Focus on Performance
Week 2: Wait, we need Enterprise features now
Week 3: Actually, let's do Mobile first
```

**Solution:**
```markdown
1. Set sprint commitment
   - Lock priorities for sprint duration (2 weeks)
   - New requests go to backlog for next sprint

2. Use change process
   - New priority requires justification
   - Must show business impact
   - Trade-off analysis required

3. Reserve capacity for urgent work
   - Plan for 80% capacity
   - Leave 20% for urgent requests
```

### Problem: Blocked items piling up

**Symptom:**
```markdown
### Blocked (8)
🔴 Feature A - Waiting for...
🔴 Feature B - Waiting for...
```

**Solution:**
```markdown
1. Daily blocker review
   - Check each blocker daily
   - Escalate if not resolved in 2 days

2. Work on unblocked items
   - Always have backup tasks
   - Don't wait idle

3. Create alternatives
   - Can we work around the blocker?
   - Can we partially implement?
```
