### 1.4 Create It!

## Step 2: Understanding What You Created

Your organization now has:

üë• **User Limit**: 20 users (for Starter plan)
‚è∞ **Trial Period**: 30 days
üîí **Isolated Data**: Completely separate from other organizations

---

## Step 3: Add Your First User

### Option A: User Self-Registration (Easiest)

1. **Share the URL**: Give users `https://acme.yourdomain.com/register`
2. **User Creates Account**:
   - They fill in name, email, password
   - They click "Create Account"
3. **First User Becomes Owner**: The first person to register is automatically the owner

### Option B: Admin Adds User (Coming Soon)

Currently, you can add users via the API (ask your developer) or wait for the UI update.

## Step 4: How Users Access Their Organization

### For Organization Members:

1. **Go to their organization's URL**: `https://acme.yourdomain.com`
2. **Log in** with their credentials
3. **Start working**: They only see data for Acme Corporation

### Important Notes:
- ‚ùå Users at `acme.yourdomain.com` CANNOT see `techcorp.yourdomain.com` data
- ‚úÖ One user can belong to multiple organizations with different logins
- ‚úÖ Each organization is completely isolated
