- Handles null/missing values
- Two sync strategies:
  - Default: Use `enhancedRole` as source of truth
  - `--role-priority`: Use `role` as source of truth

- Comprehensive reporting of changes
- Audit trail of sync operations

**Usage**:
```bash
# Preview changes
npx tsx scripts/sync-user-roles.ts --dry-run

# Sync using role as source (recommended for security)
npx tsx scripts/sync-user-roles.ts --role-priority

# Sync using enhancedRole as source
npx tsx scripts/sync-user-roles.ts
```
