## Rollback Plan

### If Deployment Fails:

1. **Stop Application**:
   ```bash
   pm2 stop bizos
   ```

2. **Restore Database** (if schema changed):
   ```bash
   psql $DATABASE_URL < /var/backups/bizos/bizos_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.sql
   ```

3. **Revert Code**:
   ```bash
   cd /var/www/bizos
   git checkout <previous-stable-commit>
   npm ci --production
   ```

4. **Restart Application**:
   ```bash
   pm2 restart bizos
   ```

5. **Verify Service**:
   ```bash
   curl https://yourdomain.com/api/health
   ```
